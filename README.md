# Madagascar-Resolution-Fix-PC

# Important Information
This fix DOES NOT fix the Windows 11 start up issue and has no intention of doing so as this is a seriously complicated issue related to the Windows 11 OS design. If you wish to play the game then it is advised that you play it via a Windows 10 Virtual Machine.

# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest MadagascarResolutionFix. zip, extract the contents into your game folder next to the Madagascar.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the Resolution you wish to use in the Fix.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is (1920x1080), which you can change to whatever resolution you wish to use in the Fix.ini file.

Resolution and aspect ratio edits are done together so you will only have to choose your resolution.

# Extra Settings
The settings within dxwrapper.ini can be played around with these are all from the wrapper found at the bottom credit of this document and instructions on how to use this are linked inside of the ini.
